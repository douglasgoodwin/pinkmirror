## I have a stick, which appears to me to be straight, but when I hold it underwater it seems to bend and distort.

---

## I know that the stick is straight and that its apparent flexibility is a result of its being seen through the water, yet I cannot change the mental image I have of the stick as being bent.

# This mental representation -- this illusion -- tells us nothing about the stick's true properties. They remain inaccessible.
