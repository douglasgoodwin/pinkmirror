how do you do ladies and gentlemen boys and girls and teachers and people
I'm Julius on the miller in physics is my business and our special business
today for several days to come
will be on the subject of waves and sound and this first program this first
lesson more deliberately on kinds of waves and their fundamental properties
now by way of preamble
if i were to put the question what is a wave you would find it very difficult
winter because some simple questions are very difficult to answer
like what is a tree what is a whole which a child once answered this way
a whole is to dig which i think is terrific so we best tell what a wave is
by showing different kinds of waves and this view we call in physics the
operational
I can't very well tell you when a wave is without writing some formidable
mathematics which may indeed only obscure the matter
but if i show you some different kinds of waves you will get a feeling for what
a wave is now we characterize waves generally into transverse transverse
waves and longitudinal also called compressional for a reason you will see
now let me show you a transverse wave
I have laid out in front of us here
a rubber tool I'm going to take this one first there are two in fact here is a
rubber tube which is so long
under such tension and so fat
we speak of the linear density remember the strings on a piano some along and
skinny and some are short and fat so this string is fixed at that in its
fixed at this end it has a certain tension a certain linear density
i'm going to give rise to a pulse in it by depressing a part of that tube and
watch
something went down and something came back
the wave propagation delivered only energy
nothing of this to went anywhere except up and down as i shall show you a little
later
so the velocity of this transverse wave where the particle disturbance is this
way and the energy propagation this way had a certain velocity
now i'm going to increase the tension and i'm going to create a pulse again
watch it whoa much faster much faster now I'm trying to get in a place where
we can see it better with respect to the table
now I've increased the tension pulling it very tightly all very fast very fast
now even tighter still very tight
Oh enormously fast
now that tube is as I often say empty but it isn't it's filled with air now I
have another beside it which is filled with sand
this one is filled with sand so it's linear density is vastly greater now if
I had all of the properties the same as in the first one and I give rise to a
pulse it moves with less velocity but high attention higher velocity so I have
demonstrated a transverse wave and i will write for you
the velocity with which a transverse wave moves it is given by the square
root of attention / the linear density that is how fat it is now those that is
a transverse wave
indeed all waves all waves answer this certain property their velocity is
governed by an elastic property an elastic property / inertia property and
this will become clearer with further demonstrations
so this was a transverse way
now the next kind longitudinal also called compressional compressional let
me show you why it is compressional remember in the case of the transverse
the particle disturbance was up and down and the energy propagation at right
angles to it
now i have a spring often called commercially a slinky
it is so fat while so tightly under certain tension
i'm going to give rise to a pulse by squeezing some up storing some energy
and letting it go
watch now a compressional pulse went down
I'll make it more deliberate
Oh not only did a congressional pumps it out but some was reflected there it is
the reflection indeed we will liken in a short time to an echo
now the sound business we have to deal with our compressional a longitudinal
waves longitudinal waves and the velocity of sound in af is given by the
square root of p / d
where p is the pressure of the atmosphere and Eva density and i hope
you see that that pressure business may be likened to an elastic factor and the
density business to an inertia factor
now there are other kinds of waves torsional waves
let me illustrate what a torsion is here is a piece of chalk
I hold the upper end firmly and I twist the lower end
yes and if one looked closely the way this was she had this suggests very
clearly than a torsional wave advance along the rod
yes let's get that again the camera got that very well
yeah notice how where is it
you see it is sheared in a twisting way now regarding the velocity of sound and
the last rated matter
here i have an array of Steel spheres on a track
they are highly a lasting I take one of the plane allow it to collide with the
system and watch how quickly this one feels the impact of that one right away
now we are to view that as of the advance of a compressional wave because
that steel ball may be viewed as having a little spring inside which suffered
some compression and that compression runs away
notice we have a little little diversion a compressor has suddenly gone on but
that's no hurt you hear a sound a compressional wave is reaching my ear
and the microphone so nothing to be worried about what i want to say here is
this how fast does this compressional wave advance
yeah well the compressional wave that emerges from my mouth is traveling at
about a thousand feet per second
here in steel this compressional wave 15,000 feet per second so if this were
where a foot long
I'll make it a foot long if that were a foot long
this one would feel that one in 115 thousandth of a second
so we have transverse waves where the particle disturbance is at right angles
to the energy propagation and a compressional a longitudinal wave when
the particle disturbance is in the direction of the energy propagation and
we will see later that transverse waves can be polarized can be polarized
imagine that rubber tube whose end is fixed over there and I have the free end
and I do this to it you know a wave advances down the tool like this at
yes down the taupe and if i had a picket fence with a slot like this or a slip
you can see that that wave could go through there but if I had it turned
like this it could not get throw and thus we discover that transverse waves
can be polarized but longitudinal are compressional ones cannot so sound
cannot be polarized but sounds suffer
Soundwave suffer all the other properties of waves they can be
reflected
that's why we get an echo they can be refracted that's why you can hear a band
around the corner of a building they can be absorbed sure if there were an
audience out here
the clothes and the hair and the whatnot the seats that are all plus and fancy
were would absorb the energy now
water waves another kind of a wave very troubled something because water waves
are a mess but i want to show you what water wave and write some mathematics
because it is very enchanting
here is a tank of water i am going to drop a little body in this tank of water
and
a little disturbance will result which goes down the trough
well it isn't too large and amplitude so I'm going to make a bigger one
watch it there is a wave
there is away and i'm going to write for you
the velocity with which water waves move and for this purpose I draw from my
notes because I have a secret to tell you
I do not ever bothered to remember formulas
indeed I let my students take examinations with all the formulas from
all the books and all the languages of the world written on them because memory
has not much virtue in my business
it is what we understand that counts so I emphasize this knowing something is
quite inadequate what you must do is understand it
so here is the velocity with which a water wave moves and notice notice how
much how much trouble some g lambda
well enter is the wavelength over 2 pi plus 2 pi t over lambda Rho now somebody
says all my god professor that's gibberish
no no no no if the waves are very small very small certain things apply if the
waves are very large other things apply this tells us the velocity of the
propagation of water waves now wave pulses
consider the following let there be an automobile engine here
remember imagination is a necessary ingredient and I hear a knock in the
engine
yeah but it was something trouble I want to locate it
what would I do well I could take a rubber tool and put one in there and the
other into my ear
but that wouldn't reveal very much because the wave conduction in rubber
tube is very bad
let me put a metal rod there's the trouble over there I think I put it
there
club club club club club club
I hear it very distinctly
conduction along metal is very good
a compressional wave and that is why of course
and that is why this kind of an instrument works any a stethoscope
oh yes I hear me quite clearly i am alive
yeah that very very importantly now i have spoken of propagation of a
compressional pulse in steel propagation of a compiler compressional pulse in
Arad consider sound being a compressional wave mechanism need
something to compress and therefore we would show that sound cannot be
propagated in empty space
that's why people on the moon could not talk with each other for this purpose I
could have a bell in a vessel take out the air more and more and more with a
pump group look pumping out the air and I would hear the bell less and less
distinctly which means what compressional waves longitudinal waves
need a medium for propagation transverse waves go best where there is nothing and
that's why we have radiation say from distant Suns stars and the like
so I have made clear i trust the fundamental distinction between
transverse waves and longitudinal waves about which this series now is engaged
sound longitudinal are compressional wave mechanism and I shall see you again
yeah
