## definitions

**Veridical, Veridicality** is a semantic or grammatical assertion of the truth of an utterance. 

**Ontology** that branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being(s).

**The argument from illusion** is Alfred J (Freddie) Ayer's argument for the existence of sense-data. The argument demonstrates the need to posit *sense-data* as the immediate objects of perception.

***

## 1. What is Common-Sense Realism? 

1. The familiar **material objects** we ordinarily take the world to be populated by – e.g., tables, stones, pieces of fruit, trees, etc. **actually exist**.
2. These familiar objects exist in the manner we ordinarily think they do, i.e. **they have a mind-independent existence**.
3. We are **sometimes perceptually aware** of such mind-independent material objects.

***

## Summary: The world includes material objects, which are mind-independent, and which we sometimes perceive.**

***

## Unpack Common Sense Realism 

***

### Claim 1: the Ontology of Material Objects

An ontological claim: apples, chairs, bicycles, and the like, do in fact exist. These are substantial three-dimensional space occupying things; entities which fill space and which can persist through time. 

***

#### **There are such things as material objects and they persist without our attention.**. 

***

#### This is a modest claim!

1. It leaves out features, events, etc. 
2. Nor is it a claim about fundamentals: material objects may be composites of more basic things

***

### Claim 2: Mind-Independence

Common-Sense Realism says that **material objects are mind-independent** in that they don't depend for their existence and nature on our perceptual awareness of them. 

Some of them may even depend on *psychological states*.

***

## What about **Metaphysical Awareness?**

Berkeley here: **For X to exist and be as it is, it must be perceived** 

Does metaphysical awareness count as perception that can guarantee existence?

***

Think of such things as constituted by perceptual awareness: what it is for them to exist is for them to be objects of perceptual awareness. 

Berkeley's **Esse est percipi**

***

#### Let's say that metaphysically awareness-dependent entities are mental entities of some kind.

Does metaphysical awareness lend existence?

***

*To call an object ‘mind-dependent’ in a metaphysical context is to suggest that it somehow owes its existence to mental activity, but not in the boring ‘causal’ sense in which ordinary artifacts owe their existence to the mind.* [^1]

[^1]: [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/)

***

can you think of examples of **metaphysical awareness-dependent entities?**

***

***

#### Consider the metaphysical negative space: **counterfactual awareness-dependence**

*If kangaroos had no tails, they would topple over.*

Do metaphysical cases ensure existence?

***

#### No. 

**metaphysical awareness of an entity is cannot guarantee existence**

***


**Material objects are not metaphysically awareness-dependent; it is not in their nature that they are perceived, they are not constituted by perceptual awareness of them.**

This is very intuitive. We think that things like apples exist in themselves, independently of our awareness of them. We can become aware of them, but becoming aware of them is not their coming to be.

***

## Case 3: Causal Dependence
> The existence of Thing X is caused by of causally sustained by perceptual awareness of Thing X. This is not sufficient for metaphysical awareness-dependence.


### Thought experiment: **Destructive Mechanisms**

***

Let's install some explosives in the sub-basement that are poised to destroy the building. 

![fit](imgs/explosives.jpg)

***

Install them with a trigger that is *inhibited* by our perception of the building. Our awareness will inhibit the explosion and the destruction of the building. 

![fit](imgs/explosives.jpg)

***

We can say that there is a *causal link* from our perception to the inhibitors, and the fate of the building is *causally* linked to our awareness, even though the building is not a mental entity. 

![fit](imgs/explosives.jpg)

***

The causal dependence of the building on our awareness has nothing to do with the nature of the building. But metaphysical awareness-dependence demands that the thing is an object of awareness because of the very nature it has.

***


Contrast **awareness-independence** with **Berkeleian Idealism** where material objects are  mental entities, constituted by perceptions of them. 

***

Berkeley holds first that material objects are in fact nothing but bundles of sensible qualities. This apple is a bundle of qualities, a particular color, form and size, and so on. But second, these qualities are nothing but ideas in the mind. 

***

#### Berkeley thinks of objects as *collections of ideas*:

>*And as several of these [ideas] are observed to accompany each other, they come to be marked by one name, and so to be reputed as one thing. Thus, for example, a certain colour, taste, smell, figure and consistence having been observed to go together, are accounted one distinct thing, signified by the name apple. Other collections of ideas constitute a stone, a tree, a book, and the like sensible things...*  [^2]

[^2]: Berkeley, 1734, 1.1

***

For Berkeley **ideas are metaphysically awareness-dependent entities**. It is in their nature that they are objects of perception. This is how we can interpret this remark among others:

> it seems no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense, how- ever blended or combined together (that is, whatever objects they compose) cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them (1.3).

***

#### **Put it all together**

the apple itself – and objects more generally – are metaphysically awareness- dependent; nothing but bundles of mental entities of a certain kind, namely, ideas. Thus Berkeley is able to say

> The table I write on, I say, exists, that is, I see and feel it... [For such objects] their *esse is percipi*, nor is it possible they should have any existence, out of the minds or thinking things which perceive them.

***

## Objection!

Surely things like apples will continue to exist even if we direct our attention away from them. Or even if we all perished and there was no perception left at all! Reply: Berkeley distinguished between finite spirits or minds – like ours – and the infinite spirit or mind: God. 

The qualities and ideas which comprise the apple are awareness-dependent but they depend upon the all encompassing mind of God who perceives at all times. We may go out of the room and not perceive the apple, but it still remains insofar as it is constituted by the mind of God.

***

In claiming that material objects are awareness-independent 

### the Common-Sense Realist endorses Realism about material objects

as opposed to Idealism. Here *realism* is a label for the position that material objects are metaphysically awareness-independent.

***

## Claim 3: Perceptual Awareness
Consciously seeing an object is one way of being perceptually aware of it, so is feeling an object, hearing an object, and so on. Common-sense is committed to the idea that we are sometimes perceptually aware of mind-independent material objects. 

***

## Following David Hume (1748/1772)

> ... suppose the very images, presented by the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any suspicion, that the one are nothing but representations of the other. This very table, which we see white, and which we feel hard, is believed to exist, independent of our perception, and to be something external to our mind, which perceives it. 

***
> Our presence bestows not being on it: our absence does not annihilate it. It preserves its existence uniform and entire, independent of the situation of intelligent beings, who perceive or contemplate it. [^3]

[^3]: David Hume

***

## we are sometimes perceptually aware of mind-independent material objects 

and

## We might also be aware sometimes of **awareness-dependent entities**.

***

## We recognize two categories of perceptual awareness:

1. **Veridical experience**: e.g., where one sees an apple and has an experience in which it looks red to one, and it in fact is that way.
2. **Illusory experience**: e.g., where one sees an apple and has an experience in which it looks red to one, when in fact it is some other color, e.g., green.

***
## Compare these experiences to hallucinations

*Dig the phosphorescent rat playing guitar!*

We don't think that hallucinations are cases of perceptual awareness. They are cases where it seems to one as if one has perceptual awareness, but one doesn't. This is because in such cases the things one seems to be aware of are not there*

*(or if they are, there being there is irrelevant to the experience which is a result of, e.g., some brain malfunction, drugs, or whatever, but not the object).

***

#### An experience counts as perceptual awareness of an object only if (a) **the object is there** (to be seen, heard, felt, etc), and (b) **the object is relevant** in some sense to the experience one has.

Is a matter of debate what it takes for an object to be relevant to the experience one has: must it cause it? If so, in what way? Perhaps instead it is part of what constitutes it? 

We won't get into debates about relevance. 

***
Our ordinary stance on veridical and illusory experiences is that they are forms of perceptual awareness, satisfying these conditions. **Hallucination** is not a form of perceptual awareness because it **fails to satisfy either condition**.

The Common-Sense Realist idea that we are sometimes perceptually aware of mind-independent material objects is correct for illusory and veridical experiences of material objects.

***

## This common-sense idea is important for at least two reasons

***

1 - it articulates something that seems to be true about our relationship to reality. It **forms part of our how we understand ourselves as beings in the world**. 

***

2 - it is part of what informs (1) and (2) of Common-Sense Realism. We so readily admit that there are mind-independent material objects because when we reflect upon our relationship to reality we see ourselves as beings who sometimes perceive such objects. 

***

> This is why reflecting upon perception can guide us, as it does, to a conception of the world as a world involving these familiar objects, existing independently of our awareness of them.  

Strawson, 1979.


***

Challenges to claim (3, *Perceptual Awareness*) of Common-Sense Realism are thus important: if the claim is false, then

1. we have to re-think our conception of how we relate to reality.
2. though it doesn't show that there *aren't* any mind-independent material objects, it will mean that we face a serious question about why we believe there are.

***

## Ayer's Argument from Illusion
The Argument from Illusion tries to show that *we are never perceptually aware of mind-independent material objects*. The argument has a two-stage structure. 

***

1 - In illusions we are not perceptually aware of material objects. The stage Snowdon calls the **Base Case Stage** and the claim it aims to establish is what French calls the **Interim Negative Claim**. 

*** 

2 - This is the **Spreading Step**, aims to generalize the Interim Negative Claim to veridical cases too, and so we end up with what we can call **The Negative Claim**: we are never perceptually aware of material objects.

***
## The Base Case Stage

> 1. When one is subject to an illusory experience, there sensibly appears to a subject to be something which has a sensible quality, F, which the mind-independent material object supposedly being perceived does not actually have.
> 2. (**Phenomenal Principle**) When, in perceptual experience, it sensibly appears to one that something has a sensible quality, F, then there is something of which one is aware which does have this quality.

***
## Therefore,

> 3. **(Interim Negative Claim)** In cases of illusion, one is no taware of the mind-independent material object one takes oneself to be aware of. (Since the mind-independent object doesn't have the quality F.)

***

## The Base Case

> 1. It seems that the wall has the quality of yellowness, yet the wall is not yellow.
> 2. Bob is perceptually aware of something which is yellow.
> 3. Since the wall is not yellow, Bob is not aware of the wall after all.

***

## The Spreading Step

> 4. The same account of experience must apply to both illusory experiences and veridical experiences.

***

![right](imgs/yellowroom.jpg)


## Therefore,

> 5. Even in a supposed veridical experience of a yellow wall, Bob is not aware of a white wall.
