# DEBATE : Newton vs. Huygens. 

Here are some notes for our next debate. 

## OVERVIEW: Is light a particle or a wave?

Newton (1643 - 1727) believed that light is a particle (corpuscle). Christian Huygens (1629-1695) a young and unproven scientist worked out some physics (using Newton's' tools) to back up his claims that light was a wave.

The earliest comprehensive theory of light was advanced by Christiaan Huygens, who proposed a wave theory of light, and in particular demonstrated how waves might interfere to form a wavefront, propagating in a straight line. However, the theory had difficulties in other matters, and was soon overshadowed by Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory of light. That is, Newton proposed that light consisted of small particles, with which he could easily explain the phenomenon of reflection. With considerably more difficulty, he could also explain refraction through a lens, and the splitting of sunlight into a rainbow by a prism. Newton's particle viewpoint went essentially unchallenged for over a century -Wikipedia

## NEWTON: Light is a Particle

Newton did have several pieces of evidence that light was a particle:

Light travels in straight lines. If light is a particle then it will not be able to diffract after going through an opening or around an obstacle. Particles always move in straight lines, and light seems to move in straight lines. (N.B. This is not the same as refraction, which is when a particle or wave changes direction after going from one medium to another medium.)

Light can travel through a vacuum. In Newton's time, the only waves that anybody really knew much about were mechanical waves, which need a substance (a medium) to move through (e.g. sound travels through air). Since they also had a pretty good idea in Newton's time that the space between the earth and the sun was a vacuum, how could light reach earth if it was a wave? If light is a particle it would have no trouble moving through a vacuum.

Light consists of of colored light (corpuscles of different sizes) that get separated in a prism or generally in glass


## HUYGENS: Light is a Wave

Huygens had a tough job, since not only does he have to disprove Newtonâ€™s two main points, he also has to overcome the power that Newton has in the world of science. He focused most of his attack on the first point outlined above.

If he could show that light would diffract when it passed through openings or around obstacles, it would prove that light was behaving like a wave. He looked at the work of Francesco Grimaldi, who had shown the edges of shadows are not perfectly sharp. If light was a particle they should be.

If light is a wave, we can explain that fuzziness as the diffraction of the waves partly around the object.

The Poisson Spot is evidence that light was able to diffract around obstacles.
He said we should imagine the crest of a wave as being made up of an infinite number of tiny waves, which he called wavelets. As these wavelets pass through an opening or an obstacle they will begin to spread out again, and this leads to diffraction.

Color comes from different wavelengths of light, not differently sized particles (this idea actually comes much later, but you can cheat a little if you can support this proposition)
