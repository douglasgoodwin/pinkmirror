# PINKMIROR | From Berkeley's idealism to content via sense data

---

We have articulated ideas about the reality of perceived objects. Now let's consider the other side of the relationship: how a sense-data collected into content? Can we talk about the objects that gather in our minds?

## review the nonconceptual content of experience
Tim Crane

---

## what a man sees depends both on what he looks at and also upon what his visual--conceptual experience has taught him to see.

-Thomas Kuhn, 1970

---
## call this "perceptual relativism"

## maybe we should use another example

---

perceptual relativism is hard to swallow, but what else is there?

---

## let's say that our perceptions have content. how is this content different for infants and adults?

Let's try a famous example of several blind men meeting an elephant.

> Blind monks examining an elephant, an ukiyo-e print by Hanabusa Itchō (1652–1724).

---

>  'The King sent for seven blind men who had seen an elephant. He asked each one of them in turn, "What sort of thing is an elephant?" They answered:

---

 - the blind man who felt the elephant's head said that an elephant is like a large clay pot
 - one who felt the ear said that it's like a basket
 - the one who felt the tusk said that an elephant is like a plow blade
 - the one who felt the tip of the tail said that an elephant is like a brush

---
## What can you say about that?

1. Are they wrong?
2. what are they missing?
3. why is the King doing this?
2. can you talk about this conceptually?

---

ok, back to this.

## we could list common perceptual experiences or observations: they both see

1. tubular
2. gray
3. shiny
4. etc.

___

that's one approach. another is to

## isolate the **non-conceptual** content of the CRT. 

---

what is non-conceptual content? three examples

1. perceptual experiences (eg. it's raining, there is a cat on the mat)
2. subpersonal information systems: mechanical algorithms (eg. identifying color)
3. states the carry *information* (eg. tree rings)

---

## start by assuming that all these things have contents. 

we can apply a test of their correctness

---

minimal condition: a Fregean Thought. 

## What?

---

# Fregean thought

1. thoughts are bearers of unrelativized truth-values
2. thoughts are psychologically real
3. thought is not contingent on any external object

---

## Let's try another model of failed concept: Cargo Cults.
