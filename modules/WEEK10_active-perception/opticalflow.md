> The Light which comes from the several points of the Object is so refracted as to ... paint the Picture of the object upon that skin called the Retina.

# what is a picture exactly?

## A picture is a surface so treated that it delivers an angular optic array to a point of observation in front of it that contains **some of the information in a sector of the original optic array** at the point of observation. Photograph.

## But a picture can also provide an eye with a different pattern of stimulus energies and the **same stimulus information that the original array provided**. Cariacature.

# Point-projection is a powerful theory.

# Point-projection includes the theory of the projected retinal image.

## Light is, in fact, projective; one can project shadows or transparent pictures and the abstract notion of point-to-point correspondence is part of the branch of mathematics called **projective geometry.**

# Projective Geometry is an elementary, non-metrical geometry.

## e.g. it is not based on a concept of distance.

# consider **graphical perspective**, a subset of projective geometry.

## **perspective: rule 1**

# the image of a straight line is a straight line

---

## **perspective: rule 2**

# images of parallel lines are coincident

---

## The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to foreshortening, meaning that an object's dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight.

## let's assume that the fidelity of a picture is analogous to the fidelity of a sound recording. 

---

## but how are the two analogous? **what** is analogous?

---

A faithful picture yields a sheaf of light-rays to a given point which is the same as would be the sheaf of rays from the original scene to a given point, that is, when the adjacent order of the points of color in the cross-section of one corresponded to the adjacent order in the cross-section of the other and when the forms in the one cross-section are congruent with the forms in the other.

---

# this faithful picture resembles a perspective system for light rays. 

## Good measure of fidelity of a photograph, useless for the caricature.

## THE SYMBOL THEORY OF PICTORIAL INFORMATION

a picture may be composed of symbols and one may learn to read a picture as the child learns to read English.

---

### critique from Nelson Goodman

## In diametric contradiction to what Gibson says, the artist who wants to produce a spatial representation that the present-day Western eye will accept as faithful **must defy the "laws of geometry."**

---

## If a picture is neither the source of a sheaf of different light rays each corresponding to a spot on the surface nor a layout of graphic symbols like writing, on the other, what is it?

---

## A NEW THEORY OF PICTORIAL INFORMATION

---

## A picture is a surface so treated that a delimited optic array to a point. Of observation is made available that contains **the same kind of information** that is found in the ambient optic arrays of an ordinary environment. 

---

## **the same kind of information**
# what information?

---

## Information consists of **invariants**, in the mathematical sense, of the structure of an optic array.

---

## **invariant 1**

#  the upper hemisphere of the optical array (the sky) tends to be much less structured and brighter than the lower hemisphere (Earth).

---

## **invariant 2**

#  objects grow or shrink as an observer moves towards or away from them.

---

## **invariant 3**

#  close objects occlude faraway objects.

---

##  Gibson hypothesized that agents evolved to directly access relevant information about themselves and the environment from the invariant structures in the array, **without the need for high level cognitive computation**.

---

# These invariant properties are linked with Gibsonâ€™s idea of **affordances**.

## So, when you see an object you don't see its surface in perspective. **You see all of it** the back as well as the front. All of its aspects are present in the experience.

so, how would you design photographs to make incorrect assumptions about the
