# how movies work

## The moving image is an illusion only if we assume our eyes are defective. If we think of seeing as a multifaceted way of exploring the world (and indeed of delighting in it), then a trick need no more be an illusion than is a difficult gymnastic or acrobatic turn or a feat of juggling. 

### TOM GUNNING, The Play between Still and Moving Images

## To begin with, 'persistence of vision' is itself an imprecise term. We can only guess that film writers are referring to what psychologists call '**positive after images**'. When a person stares at a light, he or she can still see it after the light has been turned off. Positive after-images retain the colour and brightness relations of the original stimulus. ...

---

## Common sense would suggest that the positive after-image is a plausible explanation of motion perception in film since it allows one image-frame to 'bleed' into another, despite the fact that the beam of light projecting the film-frame itself is intermittent. ...

---

## But this fusion occurs regardless of whether motion is perceived or not. The appearance of a continuously visible series of images, in other words, **is a phenomenon distinct from the appearance of motion**.

# strategy 1: **connect the light, cover the darkness**

## persistence of vision: **negative afterimages**

## persistence of vision: **Flicker fusion frequency** or **critical flicker frequency (CFF)**

1. characterizes the temporal response of the visual system
2. varies per species. humans at 60Hz., hawks at 100Hz., honeybees @ 300Hz.

## Flicker fusion frequency: demonstration

1. LED lamp
2. wave a pencil underneath it

# strategy 2: **continuity of motion**

## computation of motion requires establishing a correspondence between images across time

## this is analogous to the way that stereopsis relies on comparison of images across space

## The Reichardt detector is a model of how neurons compute motion by comparing pixels across time. It states that neurons are a part of system that detects motion and velocity. 

## so, **not this:**

## The aperture problem arises in the computation of motion because the direction of motion is ambiguous locally. this gives us the barber pole illusion/

## Another motion illusion occurs when you stare at something moving in the same direction for awhile (i.e., about a minute) and then look at something stationary immediately afterwards.
