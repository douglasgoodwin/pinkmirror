# unconscious perception

# change blindness

a complex stimulus that changes in some respect and the change goes unnoticed. But what does **unnoticed** mean? 

Here is one option, an approximation.

#The Door Study, 1998, Daniel Simons

This video shows footage from a 1998 study by Daniel Simons and Daniel Levin in which a participant fails to notice when the person he is talking to is replaced by someone else. The study was among the first to demonstrate that the phenomenon of "change blindness" can occur outside the laboratory. This was the first of many studies by Simons, Levin, and colleagues to explore how change blindness can occur in the real world.

# two possible reasons why

1. the features were experienced but not categorized. 
-or-
2. the features were categorized but not committed to short-term memory

(some evidence for the latter case)

---

# let's call this a feature. what advantages might you gain from change blindness?

---

# how might you **prime** a viewer to categorize something a particular way?

**priming** works by positing semantic networks unconsciously

# change blindness can be **perception without conscious access to what is seen**. 

---

## Things came in but were not categorized or encoded in memory though they were **accessible to memory**. 

---

let's find more examples of unconscious perception that contributes something behind the scenes. 

---

## Sperling's 1960 studies of iconic memory
# ‘The Information Available in Brief Visual Presentation’

hypothesis that one form of presentation of the visual stimulation remains accessible for a short time after the presentation.

the number of letters available as a function of the number of letters in the stimulus are graphed as the upper curves. For all stimuli and for all Ss, the available information calculated from the partial report is greater than that contained in the immediate-memory report. Moreover, from the divergence of the two curves it seems certain that, if still more complex stimuli were available, the amount of available information would continue to increase.

# Two principal properties are generally attributed to the icon

1. It is a *pre-categorical* trace, i.e. a relatively literal copy of the pattern of the visual stimulation
2. It is a *visual trace.*

# pathological cases: agnosias, blindsight

I on't advocate making conclusions from pathological cases, yet these examples reveal that perception is happening even in systems believed to be non-functional. As if your camera were recording video in its sensors. Let's design an experiment that doesn't require a handicapped subject.

## evidence that the retina records imagery

# Wilhelm Kühne's rabbit **optograms** from 1878

A photosensitive pigment present in the rods of the retina called **rhodopsin** can can be "fixed" like a photographic negative.

# the technique was used to try and identify Jack the Ripper

![right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Kuhne_Reif_human_optogram_drawing.jpg)

Optography was attempted on Mary Jane Kelly in what he called a "forlorn hope" of catching her suspected killer, Jack the Ripper.

---

forensic optography was once admitted as legal evidence. In 1924, Fritz Angerstein had been charged with killing eight members of his family and household staff. Professor Doehne of the University of Cologne photographed the retinas of two of the victims, yielding what he claimed were images of Angerstein's face and an axe used to kill the gardener. Angerstein confessed to the murders after being told about the optograms.

# embedded figures

The segmentation of this black & white image into object and background is extremely difficult. It is made much easier when the viewer is primed with a more fully rendered version of the figure

# object-oriented attention (Marroquin, 1976)

As one views this textured pattern, different shapes appear, showing the ability of attention to be object directed. One alternately perceives circles of different size.

# top-down (cognitive) vs. bottom-up (retinal) influences

The general idea of top-down influence is that complex information that is represented at higher stages of processing influences simpler processes occurring at antecedent stages. Compare bottom-up information coming from the retina.

---

> Top-down influences are seen in a number of perceptual tasks. In a curve-tracing task, cells are more strongly activated when their receptive fields lie along the curve being traced than when they are on unattended curves (Roelfsema, 1998, 2003).

# Stronger Misdirection in Curved than in Straight Motion

> curved motion, as employed by the magician in a classic sleight of hand trick, generates stronger misdirection than rectilinear motion, and that this difference can be explained by the differential engagement of the **smooth pursuit** and the saccadic oculomotor systems.

# Ebbinghaus Illusion

## A disk of a particular size surrounded by small circles is judged to be larger than a disk of the same size surrounded by big circles. 

(Illustrator demo)

---

# 3D Ebbinghaus Illusion

Haffenden and Goodale (1998) discovered that, despite the presence of the illusion of size difference, if subjects were asked to pick up the central disks, they automatically moved their finger and thumb to the same distance apart.

# Jack Gallant's Lab

The study constructs a movie-to-brain activity encoding model that accurately predicts brain activity evoked by arbitrary novel movies.

**procedure**

The left clip is the movie trailer the subject viewed in the magnet. The right clip shows the reconstruction of this segment from brain activity measured using fMRI.

1. Record brain activity while the subject watches movie trailers.
2. Build dictionaries to connect the **shapes, edges and motion** in the movies and measured brain activity. 
3. Record brain activity to a new set of movie trailers that will be used to test the quality of the dictionaries and reconstructions.

---

4. Build a random library of 5000 hours of YouTube videos. Put each clip through the dictionaries to generate predictions of brain activity. Select the 100 clips whose predicted activity is most similar to the observed brain activity. Average these clips together. This is the reconstruction.
