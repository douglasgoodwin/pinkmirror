How does perception make sense of the world? How is the sensation of light and sound rendered into recognizable imagery? How does imagery act on us? And how can images change our physiology? We will proceed by studying apparent failures in perception: optical illusions, magic tricks and mirror box therapies designed to ease pain from amputated limbs. We conclude with an appraisal of computerized tomography (CT) scans, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and other data-imaging technologies.
